904,TlAukkPK-dc,UgwVirCmfoSpGTBCMLd4AaABAg,"I’ve read hundreds of novels in my life, most of them claiming that love was the center of the universe. That it could heal any damage inside of us. That it was what we needed to survive. From Darcy to Heathcliff, I thought they were fools. That love was something fictional, only found in worn pages of a book. That it was just made up to keep humans full of hope, that it was a lie. But all that changed since I met my Elizabeth Bennett. I never thought I would find myself completely and utterly consumed by another until her. She took my hand and led me out of the darkness and showed me that, whatever our souls are made of, hers and mine are the same.
I’m sorry, please forgive me.
You once asked me who I loved most in this world.
It’s you.",1081,2022-07-14T20:47:30Z

1011,a3RDnD9YVxA,UgwzGSGkxwPhtrCDdkN4AaABAg,"When you try to resuscitate a person who has been drowning can you please clear their airway? There is no point in resuscitating people if their lungs are full of water. If you do nothing else at least clear a person's airway and put them in a recovery position, on their side.  This is such a common mistake in movies and on TV. Oxygen can not get into your lungs if it is full of water. Before attempting some sort of CPR then clear the airway first. Otherwise compressing the heart is pointless.   The order is check for danger. If it is safe for you then check to see if a person is conscious. If not then check or clear the airway. Compressing the heart is the last on the list. Heart compressions are the last thing you do. DRABC.  Danger, response, airway, breathing and then compressions.",27,2021-09-13T15:07:03Z

She thought that their relationship is real, and do not blame her at when she was never able to trust him after it. 
He did not want relationship with her at all at start. 
He was thinking that is possible to controll everything, and this is just one more dare to do, and make fun.
And it turned out different.
Simply he is not used to care about people.

Step 1 - Get inside.  Fast.  You, your friends, your family, get inside.  And no, staying in your car is not an option.  You need to get into a building and move away from the windows.

Step 2 - Stay inside.  Move as close as you can to the windows so you can shut them.  Have a forbidding tower or dungeon?  Head there.  If you don't have one, get as far into the center of Mordor as possible.  If you were outside when Sauron returned, get clean immediately.  Remove all outer clothing or armor to keep any Rings of Power away from your body.

Step 3 - Stay inside.  Listen for more information regarding Sauron's return on the horribly fried EMP-disabled radio that you never had.  Remain ABSOLUTELY MOTIONLESS until you hear news coming from THAT radio.

Don't forget to gaze into the Palantir for OFFICIAL alerts and updates.  And DON'T go outside until officials say it is safe.  All right?  You've got this.",0,2022-08-24T16:15:05Z

It felt completely underwhelming and the effects looked pretty damn bad. And honestly I also have no idea what this show is going to be about. This trailer conveyed nothing about what this show will be about or what the plot will be. Durin looked kind of stupid, and that is not something you should say for a character as a legendary as Durin. And while Galadriel being the main character and focus of the show is not a bad idea, Galadriel obviously has had some adventures in the past considering she is a long lived elf, this is not the right time to do it. Considering the oversaturation of female empowerment in modern media, to the point to where it's kind of obnoxious, a lot of people will probably just assume it's just another property being taken to further a message. Not to say female empowerment in media is a bad thing, it's just lately it seems that instead of creating interesting characters and stories that in turn empower women through good messages and writing, most are very bland, very basic and very to the point and not subtle at all. Again female empowerment in media is not a bad thing, when it is done right.

3534,bLirO_Vq7Xo,UgyImdQEt0xcfqzPgpN4AaABAg,"What a depressingly bad bit of drivel this appears. Honestly, I can't tell if they ever aspired for this to truly be a part of the Tolkien world or if it was always meant to be something else entirely. Aside from all of the obvious lore issues, and generic production design, what I find most disturbing is the utter lack of well-crafted, Tolkien-inspired dialogue. Nothing, not a single spoken word or exchange shared thus far, feels even remotely like something Prof. Tolkien would have ever written. I would not expect the RoP writers to match him, but I had hoped there would at least be moments of beauty and depth. But depressingly, to this point, there is not even the suggestion that they've managed to capture even the barest sense of the tone, texture, or weight of his language. To fail so completely at these most fundamental levels bodes ill for the entire project. I'd simply ask the show's creators and producers one question; knowing as you must just how unhappy and disappointed J.R.R. Tolkien would have been with every element of this series, how can you feel anything but embarrassment and regret having treated his timeless masterwork so shamefully? Does respect for a fellow artist's life's work mean nothing to you? While you may protest or insist that you ""meant to honor him,"" the truth of one's intention is demonstrated most clearly not by what you say but by what you *DO.* Sadly, what you've done in this case is to expose yourselves as nothing more than opportunistic grave robbers... stealing a treasure of the past and trading your soul for a few pieces of gold.

3775,bLirO_Vq7Xo,Ugyc6h2DULJi31ALzCF4AaABAg,"Amazon writers - So here is my plan. We know what people loved about the Peter Jackson trilogy. They loved the epic instrumental soundtrack, they loved the amazing story and they loved the respect shown to the source material. So bearing that in mind, I say we stick in a remix of some popular modern day song which doesn't at all mesh with the fantasy setting. Then we don't give away any clues as to what the story is about. Could that be because we don't have a story? Probably. I mean we don't have the rights to any of the well known stories so we'll just take a period we have like 2 chapters of information on and instead of doing Tolkien proud, we'll disrespect his work, disrespect Jackson and we will make something more akin to fan fiction because we can write better Tolkien that Tolkien can. 

Jeff Bezos - Good. Here, have a ludicrous amount of money and get started on it immediately. And make sure to waste most of it on terrible CGI. Because we all know that fans of the Lord of the Rings films preferred the crappy CGI in the Hobbit to the far superior practical effects and the real life costumes used in LotR film. And we will have our LotR prequel released in time to coincide with GoT prequel which will at best steal out thunder, at worse be a far superior show in all ways. How could this possibly go wrong?

Harfoots are to Hobbits as labradors are to dogs. I wanted to make that CLEAR.

I'll give you Tar-Miriel but she NEVER RULED NUMENOR.   HALBRAND don't exist.   I mean what is this? There are sooo many more things I can list but there is no use.

Every small thing I hated about the Hobbit film adaptations is also just turned to eleven here, the amount of lore inconsistencies aside, it doesn't even feel like Middle Earth, Middle Earth is meant to be believable, different, perhaps more grandiose, but also akin to our historical world, every bit of scenery, equipment and construction in this movie feels like it's straight from an adult edit of a Pixar animated movie. Like for example, a game like the Lord of the Rings online, really feels like Middle Earth, it, just like the movies have its problems, but it's believable, it feels real and like Tolkien's world that I encounter when reading. But this isn't true for anything in this trailer. It's like all the effort put into this was solely intended as perversion and subversion. No amount of ""Reacher"" and ""The Terminal List"" can make up for this abomination you've spun, it's like the darkest web of Ungoliant.

There was excitement and a buzz in the air. All the movies became mega hits.

Galadriel is definitely not the person I ever read about.

I’d swear there was no editor at all, which is ironic. And I’m nervous to see the movies because they cut all of the best parts of their relationship. The third movie was a true disappointment.

In a sense, the First World War was the battle of cousins. The financiers of the war decided to erase the last traces of the Russian Empire from history. They had already identified the most suitable employer to achieve their goals. Kaiser Wilhelm the second.
They knew the Kaiser's weakness for Tsarina Aleksandra Fyodorovna, who was the wife of the last Russian Tsar Nicholas the second.
It didn't take long for the Kaiser to find the right shooter for the job. He was Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, who was later known as Lenin.
Lenin's brother Aleksandr Ulyanov was executed for the assassination of Tsar Alexander III.
According to the agreements of the Kaiser and Lenin, the Tsar would be killed. The Tsar's family would be sent to the Kaiser. But Lenin did not obey the agreement, thinking that the Kaiser would betray him.
The execution, which took place on July 17, 1918, at 01:00, was concluded as neither the Kaiser nor Lenin had planned.
Maria and her brother Alexei were able to survive with the help of the young Prince, whom Maria had met at a prom in Romania.
This book is about the lives of Maria and Alexei after July 17, 1918.",0,2019-12-20T17:21:12Z

Now, at a time of real gamechanging watershed moments in automotive engineering....we dont have James, Richard or Jeremy going on about any of it. Its a right travesty. Ridiculous. Theres whole departments of rubbish wankers wirking at amazon that rightfully shouldnt have a job there. 

Instead we have to look forward to these individual efforts by the boys that frankly are utterly ill conceived. Id give it a pass if they still came back every other year to the old format. As much as im sure they like doing something on their own....i cant imagine any of the boys would rather be doing these ill advised run offs than taking a chiron down a long straight or an sf90 through ynh here corner.

prt1; Reseña de la película; Como cineasta del Festival Internacional de Cine, Mejor Documental de Telerrealidad 2004 y Escritor galardonado, 'Mejor Escritor Creativo' y educado en las artes superiores desde la infancia, estos son mis pensamientos mientras reviso esta película: ""La belleza de todo, dices. Dime ... Uh. Eso es fácil para ti decirlo, cortejado a los lugares más bellos con seguridad abrigada. Sin embargo, eres menos libre que los que sufrimos y donde no hay belleza, pero siempre acosados, amenazados, mutilado, falsamente. Arrestado, oprimido, desalojado y asesinado porque somos 'inconformistas', no tú. Ciertamente te conformaste. Hipócrita. Eres el más sumiso a las corporaciones que te alimentan La religión PINK de tonterías impías y payasos bailando en disfraces de payaso; sistema que te posee todos los derechos comprados y vendidos de por vida y oprime a la gente de la sociedad Cantas de libertad e inconformismo cuando en realidad no eres libre en lo más mínimo, icono solidario de la máquina na na na e En la columna de el bo dy de Dios El Propósito, por así decirlo, ak dice 'Acepto todo lo que odia los preceptos de Dios. Uno parece estar luchando contra la moralidad porque es demasiado perezoso para buscar a Dios pretendiendo que la religión organizada es la voz y los preceptos de Dios. Todo sobre ti grita que soy y también apoyo lo poco ético y amoral, socialmente inaceptable que todas las religiones del mundo advierten que NO debemos hacer en la vida. ¿Quién crees que eres? ¿Con quién estás hablando? ¿Estás hablando con los ingenuos? Los malhechores. El sistema corporativo. Compañeros de trabajo en jaulas de esclavos dorados sin voz. Y sus hijos no santificarán sus errores contra la moral social, lo que le ayudará a parecer honesto y temeroso de Dios. Prt2- Como bien sabes, los medios de comunicación no se tratan de arte para la sociedad y la cultura, sino de control político demográfico. No eres un cuadro digno de un gran arte. Vives en un mundo de tonterías. Sabes algo que vale la pena compartir. Bueno, aparte de las conocidas ventas de segunda mano del estilo de vida de payaso Upside Down Pineapple Pie. Pero meros clichés de un verso en una canción con mucho humo y espejos en el escenario. Todo tatuado, todo perforado, todo entintado, y lo que quieras de todos modos, cariño, presencia ruidosa y grosera de una calle sin hogar entrando en una suite de payasos gritando que cantan en el escenario para ser innatos y tontos como yo.

However it just feels not quite the same watching Liverpool without Gerrard. Like watching the Orioles without Cal Ripken Jr., or the Bulls without Michael Jordan, or the Miami Dolphins without Dan Marino. Almost like somethings missing. He became such a cornerstone in that club, a true leader who often carried the team on his back and willed them to victory time and time again.

A menagerie more than a jungle

ALEX TIMBERS, ROMAN COPPOLA, JASON SCHWARTZMAN — MOZART IN THE JUNGLE — 2014

The episodes are too short for enjoyment. Half an hour does not even enable a rich episode, at best a sitcom like Seinfeld. The episodes then are becoming some sort of big vignettes but the problems the series is dealing with are too big, too important, too serious to be dealt with in big vignettes that are like isolated and separate slices of a sausage you can never reconstitute.

The beautiful and original cinematography of the original? Replaced by bland random generic images. The intriguing score of the original? Gone. The show is dull and generic and crawls along in a boring way. It has clumsy exposition, wooden dialogue and a mythology that doesn't make any sense anymore. But most importantly, none of the characters make any sense. I'm okay with them being changed and ""americanized"". But they are boring and one-dimensional. They lack the depth and uniqueness of the original and are just unimaginative fillers to convey plot. The relationship between Jessica and the group is absurd. Arby is a joke. Did no one with minimal writing experience check this script before it went into production? The production value is great in this show, but it is all wasted.

I grew up on Trek but this cartoon is just a full comedy/parody not canon cartoon series where things don't have to fit into a timeline or pre-set events which is like watching Family Guy - Trek cutaway scenes they get lots of laughs or Robot Chicken - Trek mini-scenes. Try watching Archer 1999. Tripping The Rift,  Futurama, even Galaxy Quest. 
It's ok to love Trek and still laugh at this one silly show like this.
Original actors, including the ones who played  Riker and Q,  have come back to do voice work on it and said they enjoyed doing it. 
If they are ok with it, shouldn't the viewers be ok with it or just do not watch and ignore it? 
BTW the actors who played Riker and Troi were in Disney's Gargoyles animated series.
It's like watching Blue Harvest, Something, Something, Darkside. Just have a good laugh.
Why couldn't Star Wars try this in a cartoon and go full comedy too?

10926,Tzqnx8nLotE,UgyJ5ogsY4jL_E8rls14AaABAg,"Dear American Producers stop imposing your Americanised high school narrative onto UK shows. Schools in the UK do not look like this. They have a completely different vibe and it shows tremendous Arrogance or insularity to just impose your high schools aesthetic and narrative onto other countries as if they have no independent culture themselves. First sex education and now this. We need to stamp this trend out now. We do not have yellow school busses, we do not have garish crests like that, we do not have varsity jackets. You would know this if you did even the most basic research or even cared. (Watch Skins or Some Girls if you want to get the British school aesthetic. 

And no, it’s not the case that if things look different to the US the US public will not be able to watch something. If you really think that you have such low faith in your own public. Harry Potter didn’t bother being all American and it did amazingly precisely because it made sure it felt authentic which it did by consciously resisting yankwashing away it’s British character.
